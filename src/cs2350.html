    <h2>HTML5</h2>
    <p>What is html5?</p>
    <p>Well first we should talk about what HTML stands for, which is Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used for constructing and showing information on the internet. The program follows certain protocol, or rules that govern how the program reacts and responds to input. HTML was first released in 2008, and since then the developer team has released updates that have increased the efficiency of the program.

    <h2>CSS3</h2>
    <p>What is CSS3? </p>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language primarily used for showing files in a graphical user interface. CSS3 uses many different languages such as HTML, JavaScript, SVG, XML, etc. It is designed to present the content in an orderly matter that is easily manipulatable. The formatting of this language ultimately helps with the presentation of the files being read.</p>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>What is JavaScript?</p>
    <p>JavaScript is also a programming language, one of the most prominent in terms of programming languages. All major web browsers have a built in JavaScript engine equipped to read code from clients computers. It was first created in 1995, and since then has been a milestone for humanity to create code. Some have the misconception that Java, and JavaScript are the same program. Make no mistake, these are two completely different languages.</p>
